# **`Grocery Go`**

Description:

This Project is something which our Group created in order to make people budget their grocceries more efficiently and effectively. Utilizing all the knowledge learned in our Web Script Class we created our Website in a refined manner and formatted all our pages in a condensed and refreshed way. From Mastering databases, Node js and HTML+CSS we were able to effectively create our own Grocery tracking database. Grocery Go is a place where you can track all your groceries and its prices. Simply by logging into the user page you can save your account and start creating your database to track your groceries.
